DoWhiz is an agent-native product built around Oliver, the trusted AI operator that works in your existing tools and brings back finished work.

Current product model:
- Oliver-first landing and onboarding for consumer adoption.
- Personal setup dashboard for connected apps, tasks, memory, and settings.
- Multi-channel execution across email, Slack/Discord, GitHub, Google Docs, and related surfaces.
- Legacy startup/workspace routes remain available for backward compatibility, but they are no longer the primary product journey.

Primary web routes:
- `/`: public landing
- `/auth/index.html`: Oliver setup dashboard
- `/start`: legacy startup intake flow
- `/workspace`: legacy workspace route, softened away from the main journey
- `/dashboard`: internal analytics/supporting page

Startup workspace legacy backend layer:
- `DoWhiz_service/scheduler_module/src/domain/*`
- `DoWhiz_service/scheduler_module/src/service/startup_workspace/*`
- `DoWhiz_service/scheduler_module/src/service/workspace.rs` (persist bootstrap artifacts in workspace)

Current production model:
- `inbound_gateway` handles ingress (email/webhooks/chat events) and enqueue.
- `rust_service` workers consume queue items and execute tasks.
- Task state is Mongo-backed; account/auth/billing data is in Supabase Postgres.

## Quick Start (Local)

Prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain
- Node.js 20+
- MongoDB available at the `MONGODB_URI` configured in `DoWhiz_service/.env`
- `ngrok` (only for local public webhook testing)

1. Configure env:
```bash
cp .env.example DoWhiz_service/.env
# fill required keys in DoWhiz_service/.env
```

2. Start one worker:
```bash
./DoWhiz_service/scripts/run_employee.sh little_bear 9001 --skip-hook --skip-ngrok
```

3. Start inbound gateway:
```bash
./DoWhiz_service/scripts/run_gateway_local.sh
```

4. (Optional local webhook) expose gateway + update Postmark hook:
```bash
ngrok http 9100
cd DoWhiz_service
cargo run -p scheduler_module --bin set_postmark_inbound_hook -- \
  --hook-url https://YOUR-NGROK-DOMAIN/postmark/inbound
```

5. Test the personal dashboard locally:
```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/auth/index.html` after the Rust service is up. If the auth page shows a network error, confirm MongoDB is running first, then re-run the worker command above.

## Runtime Flow

```text
Inbound message
  -> inbound_gateway (route + dedupe + raw payload storage)
  -> ingestion queue (Service Bus in gateway path)
  -> rust_service worker (consume + schedule)
  -> run_task_module (Codex/Claude)
  -> outbound reply (email/slack/discord/sms/telegram/whatsapp/google workspace)
```
